# "Runes of the Forsaken":

The game takes place in a dark medieval fantasy world, where an ancient empire has fallen into ruins and chaos reigns over the forgotten realms. At the heart of this disaster are the Runes, symbols of primordial power that grant unimaginable abilities to those who possess them. However, these Runes are cursed, tied to the forgotten gods and creatures that were banished millennia ago.

Players take on the role of a Forsaken: a forgotten hero, a figure who has lost their place in history but possesses one of the lost Runes. At the beginning, the protagonist starts as a simple vagabond or an exile, but soon discovers that the Runes are the key to restoring balance to the world or plunging it further into darkness.

Lore:

Thousands of years ago, the Empire of the Eternals ruled the continent known as Aethrall, a land rich in magic, wisdom, and power. At its peak, the Rune Guardians were the protectors of these powerful relics. Each Runa represented a cosmic force: fire, ice, time, death, nature, etc. However, the power of the Runes corrupted their bearers so much that, in a desperate act, the ancient gods decided to seal them away, creating a great cataclysm that destroyed the empire.

The Forsaken are those who were forgotten in the disaster, survivors of the empire's ruins who seek vengeance, redemption, or simply to survive in a world now dominated by monsters and darkness. These Forsaken, like the protagonist, discover that the Runes can be both a blessing and a curse, granting power but also leading their bearers to madness and despair.

As the player progresses through the game, they must seek and unravel the secrets of each Runa while facing rival factions, mystical creatures, and ancient guardians who protect the ruins of lost cities. The choices the player makes will not only affect the fate of their character but also the future of the entire world.

Game Features:

Runes as the central mechanic: The Runes grant abilities and powers, but also curses that affect the characterâ€™s behavior and the world. Each Runa has a cost, and using too many may lead to corruption or death.

Open world and randomly generated dungeons: Players will explore vast territories filled with ruins, enchanted forests, and forgotten cities, facing creatures unleashed by the empire's fall.

Permanent death: Characters can die permanently, meaning the player will lose the Runes and items acquired, but with each death, the player can unlock new abilities or paths in the story.

Moral choices: The Runes offer power, but the player must decide whether to use that power for good or evil, which will influence the development of the story and the characters they encounter.

Allies and enemies: The player may encounter allies who are also seeking the Runes, some with noble intentions and others with dark motives. The player must decide whom to trust, as enemies may appear as disguised friends.

This lore combines mystery, dark magic, and epic exploration, making it the perfect foundation for a medieval fantasy roguelike game.
